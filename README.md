This is a very simple form from ex51 of Learn Python the Hardway.

My contributions to the flask/python/html/css setup:
-I added a simple css file to experiment with how HTML calls on .css files with the <link> tag.
-I added a simple <form> tag in the index.html to revert back to the hello_form.html file using the <submit> tag and the if statement within the
app.py file.
